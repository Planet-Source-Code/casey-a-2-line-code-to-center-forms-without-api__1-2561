## A 2 line code to center forms without api\!


</div>

### Description

The purpose of this code is to expand on what Ian Ippolito stated in an early post with the same code. I noticed that his same code did not state all the versions that can take advantage of this code. This code will center a form on the screen, not taking into consideration the taskbar. Yes, there are other ways of achieving this, api being one of them, but who wouldn't rather have a smaller, simpler code?
 
### More Info
 
1 form, place code in form_load
